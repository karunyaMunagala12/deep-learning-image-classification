Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The code provided in this repository demonstrates the implementation of CNN models using TensorFlow, with the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and evaluation.
Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop models that can accurately classify images into one of ten different classes: airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images, each with a resolution of 32x32 pixels. These images are divided into a training set with 50,000 images and a test set with 10,000 images.
Code Overview

The repository contains the following files:

•	image_classification.py: This Python script implements the image classification models using TensorFlow. It consists of two CNN models: one without batch normalization and another with batch normalization. The code preprocesses the data, trains the models using the training set, evaluates the models using the test set, and generates performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a classification report.
•	README.md (this file): The project's README file providing an overview of the project, instructions for usage, and other relevant information.

Results

The code provides insights into the performance of the CNN models. It evaluates the accuracy, precision, and recall of the models on the test set and generates a classification report that provides precision and recall values for each class.
Additionally, the code generates loss and accuracy plots to visualize the models' training progress over the epochs.
